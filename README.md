## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before running the setup script, install the required system dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev libgirepository1.0-dev gcc libcairo2-dev pkg-config python3-venv gir1.2-gtk-3.0
```

For better compatibility, we also recommend installing the system-wide PyGObject packages:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0
```

### Automatic Setup (Recommended)
Run the setup script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This script will:
1. Create a virtual environment with access to system packages (if one doesn't already exist)
2. Install all required dependencies
3. Create a desktop entry for easy access in the Utilities section of your application menu
4. Make the launcher script executable

The setup script will also prompt you to install system dependencies if needed.

### Manual Setup
If you prefer to install manually:

1. Create a virtual environment with access to system packages:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv teatime-venv --system-site-packages
   source teatime-venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create desktop entry (optional):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.local/share/applications
   cp teatime-accessibility.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
   ```
   This command copies the desktop entry file to the standard location for user-specific applications.

## Usage

### Running the Application
From the project's root directory, run either of the following options:

**Option 1: Command line**
```bash
./teatime-accessible.sh
```

**Option 2: GUI Startup Menu**
1. Open your desktop environment's application menu
2. Look for "TeaTime Accessibility" under the "Utilities" category
3. Click on the application icon to launch it

The application will appear in your system tray (notification area) and can be controlled from there.

### Command Line Options - broken at the moment. tracked in issue.
```bash
# Set default duration (1-999 minutes)
./teatime-accessible --duration 5
```

### Configuration
Settings are automatically saved to `~/.config/teatime/settings.json` including:
- Font scale preference
- Default timer duration

## Dependencies
- GTK 3.0+
- Python 3.8+
- PyGObject
- PulseAudio (for sound notifications)

## Uninstalling the Application

### Automatic Uninstall (Recommended)
Run the uninstall script:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

This script will:
1. Remove the desktop entry
2. Ask if you want to remove the virtual environment
3. Preserve your configuration and statistics

### Manual Uninstall
To manually uninstall:

1. Remove the desktop entry:
   ```bash
   rm ~/.local/share/applications/teatime-accessibility.desktop
   ```
   This command removes the desktop entry file from the standard location where it was copied during installation.

2. Optionally remove the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   rm -rf teatime-venv
   ```

3. Optionally remove configuration and statistics:
   ```bash
   rm ~/.config/teatime_config.json
   rm ~/.local/share/teatime_stats.json
   ```

## Development
The application consists of:
- `bin/teatime.py`: The main Python application script, which programmatically builds the GTK3 user interface.
