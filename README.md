# TeaTime Accessibility

TeaTime Accessibility is an accessibility focused timer application (app) for the Ubuntu (Desktop) environment. This app has timers with presets, reminders (audible vs to the contrary) and basic statistics for your sessions. It also has a fun rainbow-glow feature (see below)

## Features

- **Timer:** Set custom break intervals for better productivity.
- **Accessibility Integration:** Works seamlessly with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
- **Usage Statistics:** Tracks your session times and provides insights into your computer usage habits. The statistics are stored in `~/.local/share/teatime_stats.json`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before running the install script, install the required system dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev libgirepository1.0-dev gcc libcairo2-dev pkg-config python3-venv gir1.2-gtk-3.0
```

For better compatibility, we also recommend installing the system-wide PyGObject packages:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0
```

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)
First, clone the repository to a location of your choice, then run the install script:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd teatime-accessibility
./install.sh
```

This script will:
1. Create a virtual environment with access to system packages (if one doesn't already exist)
2. Install all required dependencies
3. Create a desktop entry for easy access in the Utilities section of your application menu
4. Optionally create a desktop shortcut/icon for quick access
5. Make the launcher script executable

The install script will also prompt you to install system dependencies if needed.

### Manual Installation
If you prefer to install manually:

1. Create a virtual environment with access to system packages:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv teatime-venv --system-site-packages
   source teatime-venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create desktop entry (optional):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.local/share/applications
   cp teatime-accessibility.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
   ```

After running these commands, you'll find "TeaTime Accessibility" in the Utilities section of your application menu. If you choose to create a desktop shortcut during the installation process, you can also launch the app directly from your desktop in future instances.

## Installation Locations

When you run the install script, here's exactly where each component is installed:

1. **Virtual Environment**: 
   - Location: Inside the project directory as `teatime-venv/`
   - This is a local virtual environment that stays within your project folder

2. **Desktop Entry**:
   - Location: `~/.local/share/applications/teatime-accessibility.desktop`
   - This allows the app to appear in your system's application menu under "Utilities"

3. **Desktop Shortcut** (if you choose to create one):
   - Location: On your desktop (e.g., `~/Desktop/teatime-accessibility.desktop`)
   - This provides a direct shortcut icon on your desktop

4. **Application Files**:
   - All application files remain in your project directory (wherever you cloned the repository)
   - This includes the main Python script, assets, and configuration files

5. **User Data**:
   - Configuration: `~/.config/teatime_config.json`
   - Statistics: `~/.local/share/teatime_stats.json`

The important thing to note is that the application itself is not moved or copied elsewhere - it runs directly from your project directory. The install script simply:
1. Sets up the virtual environment for isolated dependencies
2. Creates convenient access points (desktop entry and/or desktop shortcut)
3. Ensures all necessary components are properly configured

This approach keeps everything contained within your project directory while providing convenient access methods through the standard desktop environment interfaces.

## Usage

After installation, you can run the application in one of the following ways:

### Option 1: Applications Menu
1. Open your applications menu
2. Look for "TeaTime Accessibility" under the "Utilities" category
3. Click on the application icon to launch it

### Option 2: Command Line
1. Navigate to the project directory (wherever you originally cloned the repository)
2. Activating the existing python virtual environment. Important and if you are new to python, you only have to activate the python virtual environment once on a machine (unless you delete it for some reason, or uninstall python e.t.c):
   ```bash
   source teatime-venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Once your python environment has been created. The first time and then subsequent times, you can simply Run the application like any standard *nix script: The shell script is designed to invoke the python (.py script) that programmatically will build the app in the GTK environment
   ```bash
   ./teatime-accessible.sh
   ```

### Option 3: Desktop Shortcut
If you chose to create a desktop shortcut during installation:
1. Navigate to your desktop
2. Right-click on the "TeaTime Accessibility" icon
3. Select "Allow Launching" from the context menu
4. Double-click the icon to launch the application

The application will appear in your system tray (notification area) and can be controlled from there.

Note: The virtual environment has been created in the project directory and does not need to be recreated unless you run the uninstall script.

### Command Line Options - broken at the moment. tracked in issue.
```bash
# Set default duration (1-999 minutes)
./teatime-accessible --duration 5
```

### Configuration
Settings are automatically saved to `~/.config/teatime/settings.json` including:
- Font scale preference
- Default timer duration

## Dependencies
- GTK 3.0+
- Python 3.8+
- PyGObject
- PulseAudio (for sound notifications)

## Uninstalling the Application

### Automatic Uninstall (Recommended)
Run the uninstall script from the project directory:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

This script will:
1. Remove the desktop entry
2. Ask if you want to remove the virtual environment
3. Preserve your configuration and statistics

### Manual Uninstall
To manually uninstall:

1. Remove the desktop entry:
   ```bash
   rm ~/.local/share/applications/teatime-accessibility.desktop
   ```

2. Optionally remove the desktop shortcut:
   ```bash
   rm ~/Desktop/teatime-accessibility.desktop
   ```

3. Optionally remove the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   rm -rf teatime-venv
   ```

4. Optionally remove configuration and statistics:
   ```bash
   rm ~/.config/teatime_config.json
   rm ~/.local/share/teatime_stats.json
   ```

## Development
The application consists of:
- `bin/teatime.py`: The main Python application script, which programmatically builds the GTK3 user interface.
