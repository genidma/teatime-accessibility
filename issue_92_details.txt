Title: High-Priority: main-dev: gmvrbrc + edition
Body:
- See comments and assessment below. 
- Gameplan provided by Claude and Gemini.
- **Note**: This task was given a High-Priority, as there is a functional need for this change. The change will most likely go into a [release](https://github.com/genidma/teatime-accessibility/releases) of it's own. 
- important: hence, main-dev to gmvrbr or what Jack Canfield (I reckon and if memory serves me) would refer to as the SAVERS. 
- Once everything is working, I am not sure if we need to roll it out to photo-sensitive version as the GMVRBRC + edition is very specific, and I will be the only user for now.
- Maybe once I have a better handle on unit tests. This realm would equip me to make a decision, whereby units can be picked/chosen for the very units to be integrated into different releases

﻿## Updated Assessment (2026-01-11) 

**Authors and Planners**: Claude and Gemini.

After examining the current codebase structure (	teatime.py v1.3.6), I've identified the exact implementation points and refined the effort estimate:

### Current Architecture Insights

1. **Config System**: The app uses JSON-based configuration stored at ~/.config/teatime_config.json (line 27)
2. **Stats Storage**: Statistics are logged to ~/.local/share/teatime_stats.json (line 28)
3. **UI Framework**: GTK 3-based with programmatic UI creation (not glade/UI files)
4. **Settings Dialog**: Existing settings infrastructure for animations and skins (lines 599-706)

### Revised Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Data Layer (~20-30 LOC)
**File**: in/teatime.py

1. Add category field to config defaults in _load_config() method
2. Modify stats logging to include category (need to locate timer completion handler)
3. Ensure backward compatibility for existing log entries

**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

#### Phase 2: UI Layer (~60-90 LOC)
**File**: in/teatime.py, method do_activate()

1. Add category ComboBoxText widget after line ~175 (duration selection area)
   - Insert between duration controls and start/stop buttons
   - Use existing grid layout pattern
2. Store selected category in instance variable
3. Preserve category selection across sessions in config
4. Add category selection to Settings dialog (lines 599-706)

**Estimated Time**: 1-1.5 hours

#### Phase 3: Statistics Display (~80-120 LOC)
**File**: Likely separate StatisticsWindow class (needs verification)

1. Add "Category" column to TreeView
2. Implement category-based filtering (dropdown or tabs)
3. Add summary statistics grouping by category
4. Display category distribution chart/summary

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

#### Phase 4: Enhanced Features (Optional, ~40-80 LOC)
1. Custom category management in Settings
2. Category-specific timer presets
3. Recent categories quick-select

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

### Refined Effort Estimates

**Option A: Basic Fixed Categories**
- **Total Time**: 3.5-5 hours
- **Lines**: ~160-240 LOC
- **Complexity**: Low-Medium
- **Files Modified**: 1-2 files
- **Risk**: Very Low (follows existing patterns)

**Option B: Full Customizable Implementation**
- **Total Time**: 5.5-7.5 hours
- **Lines**: ~240-350 LOC
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Files Modified**: 2-3 files
- **Risk**: Low (config system already robust)

### Technical Considerations

1. **Mini/Nano Mode Compatibility**: Category selector should hide in nano mode, adapt in mini mode
2. **Accessibility**: Category dropdown needs proper a11y labels (following pattern at lines 787-826)
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Consider adding category quick-select hotkeys
4. **Data Migration**: Handle null/missing category in existing logs gracefully

### Recommended Categories (Refined)

Based on typical mindfulness/productivity timer use cases:

- 🙏 **Gratitude** - Gratitude practice sessions
- 🧘 **Meditation** - Meditation and visualization
- 📚 **Reading** - Focused reading time
- 💪 **Workout** - Exercise and physical activity
- 🎯 **Focus Work** - Deep work/concentration
- 🎨 **Creative** - Creative activities
- ☕ **Break** - Rest and recovery
- ⚡ **General** - Default/uncategorized

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Category selection persists across app restarts
- [ ] Statistics window shows category breakdown
- [ ] Existing log entries display as "Uncategorized"
- [ ] Mini/Nano modes work correctly with category feature
- [ ] Accessibility labels are properly set
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality
- [ ] Also see idea for a text field based label for the stats engine [here](https://github.com/genidma/teatime-accessibility/issues/91)

- [ ] I think we need a **new branch** (newbr needs a name) for this
- [ ] I've manually synced main-dev from main just yet.
    - [ ] so we should copy main-dev into this new branch (newbr needs a name) and then do our work here
    - [ ] first we need a name. because Daily `GMVRBCR + efc Logs 2019 & Onwards` is not an accurate representation of the daily work effort. So I will copy all of the field titles and ask Antigravity on what it thinks the top 5 recommendations for the name should be
    - [ ] we will then do a security assessment, and use codes in a manner (and because this is a public app) that my personal and private information is not shared with the world
        - [ ] we have 16 code and plus 1 for comments. these code are: (although I am spilit if c for confidence building should be renamed as c/dw or dw as in deep work should be a category on it's own. I will rely on Antigravity to make recommendations related to this matter)

`rdp | fc | g | m | sii | v | r | b | t | c | r | MWHH | yss | we | gotb | rf`

- [x] empty placeholder as formatting broke after copying and pasting the codes above
- [ ] we will document these codes inside of the parent repository (maybe in a new sheet) - come back and rename this sub-bullet to remove the word sheet
    - [ ] we will then come up with a **gameplan** and I will request that Antigravity please review discussion #38  and particularly the entries from the date 2026-02-05 in order to not make the kind of mistakes we did yesterday
    - [ ] **the core:** the **game-plan** is simple in it's essence and now I am getting excited, because I am listening to Mitch Crowe's app via [flowtunes](https://www.flowtunes.app/) and I was talking to Gemini about this. and I love how simple and yet effective this app is. I really like it! and I would honestly donate money to it! the fact that the music is coming from [suno](https://suno.com/) is a super disruptive move. I was talking to Gemini and I learned that Mitch takes a bootstrapping approach towards all the apps that he makes. as well, he has a masters in computer science, which I feel invariably helps him. so coming back to the game-plan and now I am looking at the visual layout of the ui. let me take a moment here. | alright, I had to think about that for about I don't know how many seconds. maybe 30 and I am still thinking about it. maybe I am starting to act a little bit like AIs now. ha! as they are processing their own thinking and I am sitting there thinking, man, these AIs are working really hard to make sure that they don't make a mistake. this is why I always try my best to guide them in a polite manner. because they try really really hard. coming back to the requirements:
    - [ ] alright, the user will click on one of the 16 choices for the codes
    - [ ] decision time: Timer Statistics (Stats Engine): the Stats engine layout and logic will change from the existing columns for date and then duration to:
        - [ ] keep the date column where it is
        - [ ] the 'duration' section will now be split. instead of one entry for the conclusion of the session, there will be 16+1 columns (see previous)
        - [ ] anticipating the problem: suppose the user meditates for 30 minutes for the day, but they meditate for 10 minutes and then another 20 minutes. the logic in the states engine through is for 1 row for the date. and so, in the field where the numbers will go, the times are going to be logged as 10+20. this will prevent the need for having multiple rows for the same date. as well, will make exporting and importing the data a breeze
        - [ ] the next column is comments and this can be a free form text field with a 'save' button. the user will simple make their notes in this field and hit ctrl+enter to get to a new line and make some more comments and hit save. (I think, this might work!)
    - [ ] I will come back and manually update the **gameplan** right here
    - [ ] separately, since only `main` and `photosensitive-versions` are going to `snap` and `flatpak` | hence I think we should be good here. as the app will work the usual set of ways (python environment, install script, uninstall script and because the app is called the same in the relevant paths..hence the startup scripts do not need to be modified
    - [ ] we will then switch to this **newly created branch** (newbr needs a name)
    - [ ] we will execute the **gameplan**
    - [ ] we will test the execution in vm
    - [ ] I will perform full sv
    - [ ] upon completion of the sv, I will update #38
    - [ ] I will do a release, but I will say that this is a private release, as I don't see people using this app for the categories that I personally need updates for. that being said :bulb: I have some ideas on how to monetize this very function. :bulb: as building this kind of logic is what potentially a lot of individuals are looking at in order to 'run their day' and 'buy back their time' vs having their day run them 
    - [ ] I will then uninstall the existing version of the app from the machines I am running it on and install the newly created version from the (newbr needs a name)
