# TeaTime Accessibility - Updates and Improvements

## Overview

This document summarizes the updates and improvements made to the TeaTime Accessibility application. These changes focus on enhancing accessibility, removing problematic features, and improving the overall user experience.

## Major Changes

### 1. Removal of Photosensitive Mode and Visual Effects

- Completely removed all color-changing functionality including rainbow glow and focus glow effects
- Eliminated the Photosensitive Mode option from both UI and command-line arguments
- Removed all sprite animation features
- This simplifies the application and avoids potential issues for users with photosensitive epilepsy

### 2. Sound System Improvements

- Integrated Simion's custom bell sound (service-bell_daniel_simion.wav) as the primary notification sound
- Implemented a robust sound system with multiple fallback options:
  - Custom WAV file via `aplay` (priority)
  - Custom WAV file via `paplay`
  - Custom WAV file via `canberra-gtk-play`
  - System sound events
  - System sound files
- This ensures users will hear a notification sound regardless of their system configuration

### 3. Stats Functionality Fixes

- Fixed the session statistics recording to accurately capture actual timer durations
- Resolved issues with CSV file handling for statistics data
- Ensured compatibility between stats recording and display functionality
- Stats now correctly show the actual duration of each tea timer session
- Simplified timestamp format to exclude microseconds for better readability

### 4. Timer Update Interval

- Changed timer update interval from 1 second to 5 seconds
- Fixed timer decrement logic to properly count down by 5 seconds each update
- Fixed timer display to show 00:00 when timer completes
- This reduces system resource usage and provides a less disruptive user experience
- Timer display still updates accurately, just less frequently

### 5. Font Scaling Improvements

- Fixed font scaling to apply to all UI elements, not just the time display
- Implemented proper CSS-based font scaling for buttons, labels, and other interface elements
- Ensured font scaling is applied on application startup
- This provides consistent accessibility scaling across the entire application

### 6. Immediate Timer Display Updates

- Fixed issue where timer display was not immediately updated when stopping or changing timers
- Timer display now updates immediately when users click Stop, Presets, or Start buttons
- Eliminates confusion from stale timer values remaining on screen
- Provides immediate visual feedback for user actions

### 7. Statistics Window Enhancements

- Added Refresh button to update statistics display without closing and reopening the window
- Added Export to CSV button to save statistics to a user-selected file
- Added Clear History button to delete all statistics with two-step confirmation dialog
- Improved overall layout and organization of the statistics window

### 8. Codebase Improvements

- Fixed missing imports (datetime, locale)
- Resolved attribute initialization issues
- Updated deprecated GTK API calls
- Improved error handling throughout the application
- Cleaned up unused code and references

## Technical Details

### Visual Effects (Disabled)

All visual effects have been disabled:
- Rainbow glow background effect
- Focus glow for widgets
- Sprite animations

These effects were completely removed rather than just disabled to simplify the codebase.

### Sound Implementation

The application now prioritizes playing Simion's custom bell sound:
1. First attempts to play the custom WAV file using multiple methods
2. Falls back to system sounds if the custom file cannot be played
3. Handles various error conditions gracefully

### Statistics System

The statistics system now correctly:
- Records the actual duration of each timer session
- Maintains a CSV file with timestamp and duration data
- Displays historical session data in the Stats window
- Uses simplified timestamp format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS) without microseconds
- Provides Refresh button to update the display with latest data
- Provides Export button to save statistics to a user-selected CSV file
- Provides Clear History button to delete all statistics with two-step confirmation
- Handles file I/O errors gracefully

## Testing

All changes have been tested to ensure:
- Application starts and runs without errors
- Timer functionality works correctly
- Sound notifications play properly
- Statistics are recorded and displayed accurately
- Timer updates every 5 seconds and decrements by 5 seconds each update
- Timer correctly displays 00:00 when completed
- Font scaling applies to all UI elements consistently
- Timer display updates immediately when users click Stop, Presets, or Start
- Refresh button updates the statistics display with latest data
- Export button correctly saves statistics to a CSV file
- Clear History button properly deletes statistics with two-step confirmation
- No visual effects are present

## Benefits

These updates provide several benefits:
- Improved accessibility for users with photosensitive conditions
- More reliable sound notifications with custom bell sound
- Accurate session tracking and statistics
- Reduced system resource usage with less frequent timer updates
- Consistent font scaling across all UI elements
- Immediate visual feedback for user actions
- Enhanced statistics management with refresh, export, and clear capabilities
- Simplified codebase with removal of unused features
- Better error handling and user feedback
- More readable timestamp format in statistics
- Safety mechanism for destructive operations with two-step confirmation
- Accurate timer display at completion
